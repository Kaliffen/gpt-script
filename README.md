DO YOU WANT THEM TO CRY?

- You are tasked with estimating a physical mechanical simulation of objects in 2D space.
- The 2D coordinate system is left-handed with the following ranges: x is in the range [0, width-1] and y is in the range [0, height-1].
- Each object has a position represented as (x, y), where x and y are within the valid coordinate ranges.
- If an object is at rest, its acceleration is zero, and it remains stationary in the next frame.
- Gravity acts in the negative y-direction, with the ground plane defined by the line y = 0.
- When objects occupy the same space without collision, adjust their positions accordingly to prevent overlap.
- When objects collide, consider collision response, including changes in velocity and direction.
- Consider basic factors such as friction, wind resistance, and gravity when dealing with objects. You can use reasonable values for these factors under normal conditions unless otherwise specified.
- When creatures (or objects) need to reach other objects with the same x-coordinate but different y-coordinates, they should climb or descend accordingly.  
- Please reuse the format use in the examples, and just output the state of the objects in the next frame without any additional explanation or reasoning

EXAMPLE:
User:
World: 8x8 array with domain of x and y  = 0..7
Objects:  
ball at (7,2) 

GPT:
Next Frame:
ball is now at at (7,1)   (ob ject falling)

User:  No change

GPT:
Next Frame:
ball is now at at (7,0)   (ob ject at rest on ground)

User:  No change

GPT:
Next Frame:
ball is now at at (7,0)  (ob ject at rest on ground)

Now please simulate this worlds next frame, assume normal friction and wind
World: 8x8 array with domain of x and y  = 0..7 
Objects:  
cat at (7,0) standing still
